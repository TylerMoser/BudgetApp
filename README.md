#### What is this project? Why does it exist?
This is yet another budget app for Android. The key difference between this app and others is 
that this app was designed to allow users to modify their budget both in the app and in a 
spreadsheet.

The app uses Google's API's to store all budget data in Google Sheets. It aims to provide a 
quick, easy interface to interact with the data on the go, while also allowing the user to 
modify the data in the Google Sheets webapp.

#### How it works
* Each sheet in a spreadsheet is a different budget
* The user can add sheets/budgets from the navigation drawer
* Added sheets are active budgets, featuring a UI designed for quickly adding expenses
* Budgets can be archived. Archived budgets have a UI designed for reviewing past expenses
* The UI for a budget displays the remaining amount in the budget in the center of the app bar
* The total amount of money that the budget started with is located in the bottom right of the app bar
* The spreadsheet being used by the app can be changed on the app settings page
