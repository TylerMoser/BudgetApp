Please use GitHub's issue functionality to report bugs or request new features. If reporting a bug,
include an explanation of what the issue is and the steps to reproduce it. If requesting a new
feature, the more information, the better.

If you want to take the next step and make changes to the code, submit a pull request. Please
include a detailed explanation of the change being made and why, along with the pull request. If 
relevant, also include the issue number being addressed.

This project can be downloaded and imported directly into Android Studio.

All app development should occur in the stable branch.

Contributors should create a new branch off of stable for each app change they are implementing.
Where possible, name these branches to reflect an issue or purpose. When done, submit a pull
request against stable. After your changes are approved they can be merged with stable. At
development milestones or regular intervals the stable branch will be merged with master to create
a new release.
